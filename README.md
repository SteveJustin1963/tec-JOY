# tec-JOY
to read XY pots with no ADC, we can read and write to a port with an RC circuit timing the duration. R will be joysticks variable 10k ohm pot and Cap is a constant, then we discharge the port foirst write 0 to it then write 1 to it and then time the charge up time constant for the cap which = R*C in seconds. this gives us the xy positon,
