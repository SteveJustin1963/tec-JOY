# tec-JOY
In another project, tec-SCOPE, the first stage is to read an analogue joy stick input and convert it to xy h-bridge motor control. 
to do this with no ADC, we can use a RC circuit, R will be input from joysticks variable 10k ohm pot and Cap is a constant, then charge up time constant for Cap = R*C in seconds.
