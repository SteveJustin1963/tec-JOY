Copy Left. Draft, use at risk

A typical joystick has 2 of 10k pots for XY. I see so many chucked out in old consoles etc and cheap to buy. By reading and writing 0 or 1 to a port we can charge / discharge the C of an RC circuit. by timing the duration it takes to charge or discharge a fixed value C we can estimate the value of R which estimates the position. 

The duration = R*C, per second. C is fixed.

We will measure with charging only. We write 0 to the LHS of cct to discharge C and wait 5RC times so it reaches zero. Then we write pulsed 1â€™s again to the port and as the current flows thru R of the pot value it charges the C. We pulse read the RHS of cct with another port and repeat count until we see a 1. When we read the port, R of 470k stops discharging C. The total reads the are the count = approx = RC * f counts (per seconds). Using f as a scaling factor. This gives us the xy position.
Also pressing down on the knob switch calls /INT and latches 0. The cap holds the line at 0 long enough so the latch can be read.

The variable time rc is also proportional to how far the stick is pushed and can also serve as velocity of moving the input or position in a matrix. Most cases only need to know if it was a push not how far it went. So next cct will simplify the pot into a switch using comparators.
